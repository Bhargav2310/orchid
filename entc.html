            About Department
        </h2>
        <p>Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering at NKOCET has taken development as a continuous
            process and has assured this through upgrading the academic programs, research infrastructure and
            laboratories. In order to ensure high standards of education, the department is constantly upgrading
            itself by adding well equipped laboratories to supplement the theory courses. We have a team of highly
            qualified, experienced, dedicated and self-motivated faculty members. Students are provided with a solid
            foundation to formulate, solve and analyse engineering problems.</p>
        <p>The department has strong industry-institute interface, which helps in bridging the gap between college
            education and industry needs. Various initiatives are regularly taken to give the students a clear and
            decisive edge in employability through modular and supplementary courses based on industry needs. These
            include soft skill training and employment oriented co-curricular and extracurricular courses. The
            Department trains students to be team players to work on multi-disciplinary projects and extend their
            abilities to co-relate engineering issues to the broader social context.</p>
